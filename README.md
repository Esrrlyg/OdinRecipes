Welcome to my attempt of the first Odin Project Foundations Project;
Project: Recipes

During this Project I will demonstrate how to utilise multiple HTML pages and linking them together using the a href tag, images will be included with img scr tags, and lists (both ordered and unordered) will be used for the meat of the recipes.
